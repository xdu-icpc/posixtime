                F**king all Bulls**t Code of Conduct
                    Version 0.1,  Sept 26, 2018

Dissing any guy is strictly prohibited in the development and maintenance
process of this project, unless:

0. This guy has violated this Code, or the license of the project;
1. This guy's code really sucks.

If you believe someone is evil (even if this guy hates LGBT) you should
report this issue to local authority (for e.g. police station or court),
instead of this project.

You don't need to sign this Code.  But, any violation of this Code may be
regarded as spamming.

If you don't like this Code you may dismiss this project, or fork it under
GNU AGPL version 3.0 and remove the Code.

Thanks for your cooperation.
